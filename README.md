# Junior Dev Journal :notebook: 

_The purpose of this journal is to document my first month as a developer on a digital team after 
completing coding bootcamp. I hope that this journal will help me chart my professional growth and help others that are currently on or considering a similar path understand what lies ahead._

* Week 1-2

Over the past two weeks, I've been getting set up in my new role as a junior developer 
including gaining access to online systems and meeting colleagues in various departments 
to better understand the business mode. I observed a user feedback session which 
helped me to understand the users' needs. I've been reviewing the code base for the main product 
that is in development - a tool to help users make payments and book home repairs. I've also 
tried to document work flow to help refine the onboarding process for future devs on my team. 

* Week 3

    * Day 1
        * Daily standup call: We review progress, identify blockers, and make plans for the next sprint
        * Identify remaining onboarding items
        * Review Trello for outstanding issues and work with other devs to fix a bug: 
            * The codebase is massive and still largely unfamiliar to me, so we use the console to identify 
            the objects and arrays and related data that we are working with. 
            *With a big hint from a senior dev, we solve the issue and then refactor to minimise the code. 
        * Research and practice version control with git rebasing

        * :relaxed: Reflections: If you're anxious about preparing for your first coding job, try to refocus that energy onto what's in front of you at the moment (finishing your projects, practicing for interviews, improving your git version constrol skills). The apps you will be working on in your first job will likely be more vast than anything you previously worked on while studying so be patient with yourself while you get familiar with the code base. If anything, contributing to open source projects can help you prepare for jumping into a new team. Jump into an existing app and try to understand how everything fits together so that you can better understand the context of raise issues. 

   * Day 2
        * Review the data model diagram: we walked through the flow of data with visual aids and identified changes that need to made in the architecture. 
        * Preplanning for next sprint: From tomorrow, a new two week sprint begins. :party: 
        * Reviewed design guide for clean code
        * Walked through objects and properties in the User model in prep for the next sprint
        * :relaxed: Reflections: Today, I particpated in several super helpful in providing context on the product, where we've been and where we are headed. 

    * Day 3 (draft to be updated by end of day)
        * Retro (reflecting on the last sprint): Following the conclusion of each sprint, the team 
        identifies and discusses: 
            * What worked? 
            * What could have been improved? 
            * What didn't work? 
            * Actions

        * Feature flags: (define here)
            * unit testing
        * Discuss which items to push to staging
        * Miro for diagrams
        * Next sprint! 
            * CRUD contact details writable to API
            * Complete accessibility course
            * Designing certain fields for mobile first vs qwerty
            * End goal: first iteration of contact details page working on staging, 
            with feature flag available for a demo. "As a customer, I can add a phone number."
