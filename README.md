##Junior Dev Journal##
The purpose of this journal is to share my first days as a developer on a team after 
completing a coding bootcamp. Previously, I was a freelancer working on smaller scale 
projects mostly on my own. 

The past two weeks, I've been getting set up in my new role as a junior developer 
including getting access to online systems, meeting colleagues in various departments 
to better understand the business model and took part in a user feedback session which 
helped to understand the user's needs. I've been reviewing the code base for the main product 
that is in development - a tool to help users make payments and book home repairs. I've also 
tried to document work flow to help refine the onboarding process for future devs on my team. 

Week 3

Day 1
Daily standup call: We review progress, identify blockers, and make plans for the next sprint
Identify remaining onboarding items
Review Trello for outstanding issues and work with other devs to fix a bug: 
    *The codebase is massive and still largely unfamiliar to me, so we use the console to identify 
    the objects and arrays and related data that we are working with. 
    *With a big hint from a senior dev, we solve the issue and then refactor to minimise the code.
