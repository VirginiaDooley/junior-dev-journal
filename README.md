# Junior Dev Journal :notebook: 

_The purpose of this journal is to share my first days/weeks as a developer on a team after 
completing a coding bootcamp. I hope that this journal will help others that are currently on 
or considering a similar path understand what lies ahead. Previously, I was a freelancer working on smaller scale projects mostly on my own. I also want to use this journal to track my professional growth._

The past two weeks, I've been getting set up in my new role as a junior developer 
including getting access to online systems, meeting colleagues in various departments 
to better understand the business model and took part in a user feedback session which 
helped to understand the user's needs. I've been reviewing the code base for the main product 
that is in development - a tool to help users make payments and book home repairs. I've also 
tried to document work flow to help refine the onboarding process for future devs on my team. 

* Week 3

    * Day 1
        * Daily standup call: We review progress, identify blockers, and make plans for the next sprint
        * Identify remaining onboarding items
        * Review Trello for outstanding issues and work with other devs to fix a bug: 
            * The codebase is massive and still largely unfamiliar to me, so we use the console to identify 
            the objects and arrays and related data that we are working with. 
            *With a big hint from a senior dev, we solve the issue and then refactor to minimise the code. 
        * Research and practice version control with git rebasing
        * Resources:

            * [Thoughbot Guides](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides)
            * [Don't mess with master: Working with branches](https://thenewstack.io/dont-mess-with-the-master-working-with-branches-in-git-and-github/)
        * Reflections: If you're anxious about preparing for your first coding job, try to refocus that energy onto what's in front of you at the moment (finishing your projects, practicing for interviews, improving your git version constrol skills). The apps you will be working on in your first job will likely be more vast than anything you previously worked on while studying so be patient with yourself while you get familiar with the code base. If anything, contributing to open source projects can help you prepare for jumping into a new team. Jump into an existing app and try to understand how everything fits together so that you can better understand the context of raise issues. 

   * Day 2 (draft; will update at the end of the day)

        * Review the data model diagram
        * Preplanning for next sprint
        * Review design guide for clean code
